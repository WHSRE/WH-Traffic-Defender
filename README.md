# WH-Traffic-Defender

A version of these 3 scripts are what was used by William Hill to manage traffic for the biggest day of the betting year - the Grand National.

2021 was a year like no other, with shops closed and no 2020 race, predicting the number of online customers was an extremely difficult task. With the help of a 3rd party for the backend queue, William Hill built a solution on AWS to manage the traffic profile at the top of the tech stack.
